In the 2010s, Cadbury recieved complaints that their new chocolate was too sweet. Cadbury did not change their chocolate bar recipie, they only changed the shape.
Spence [1] a Psychologist suggest it has something to do with cross-modal perception where change in a chape influences how we perceive its taste.

Something like the Bouba/Kiki effect, where regardless of culture, language and age. People rend to associate the spikey shape with the sound "kiki" and the rounder shape with the sound "bouba".

But this isn't the entire story. Cadbury claims that the rounder chocolate melts in your mouth better, which might also be the reason for sweeter-tasting chocolate. 

As we delve deeper into the realm of sweetness, we'll uncover additional forces of our perception of sweetness. As we become more aware to them, we will be able to pull on more levers to adjust sweetness in cocktail than just syrups.
