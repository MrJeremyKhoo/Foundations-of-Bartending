In the 2010s, Cadbury recieved complaints that their new chocolate was too sweet. Cadbury did not change their recipe. The company only changed the barâ€™s shape from angular to more rounded but there was an unmistakable boost of sweetness. Research into matter, showed that we have tendencey to  associate roundness with sweeter flavors. But this wasn't the entire story.

A roundner shape means higher surface area for the same volume; mean this means that the new chocolate melted faster in the mouth and also had a stronger aroma.

Cadbury's gustatory drama. Draws attention to overlooked parts of the sweetness equation. As we explore, the subject of sweetness, we will meet more unexpected factors of sweetness. From music, colour to time of day. Learning or at the least being aware of the other factors will allow us to play with sweetness in our drinks on more dimentions than just the sugar amount.
