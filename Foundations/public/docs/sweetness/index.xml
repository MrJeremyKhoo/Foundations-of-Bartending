      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview &lt;a href=&#34;#overview&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;i class=&#34;material-icons align-middle&#34;&gt;link&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the realm of taste, sweetness is far more than just the molecular presence of sugar or glucose. It is an intricate symphony—a perception shaped by how food is designed, the scents that accompany it, and even the temperature at which it’s enjoyed. Consider, for example, the story of Cadbury’s Dairy Milk. Not long ago, consumers were astounded when the company changed the bar’s shape from angular to more rounded. The recipe remained unchanged, yet tasters reported an unmistakable boost in sweetness. As researchers later explained, our brains tend to associate roundness with sweeter flavors—a subtle crossmodal cue that alters our entire sensory experience. In one study, scientists observed that the rounded chocolate not only melted differently but also released its aroma in a manner that enhanced the perception of sweetness, confirming that a product’s geometry can influence taste perception in profound ways [1].&lt;/p&gt;</description>
