This plant, &lt;em&gt;Saccharum officinarum&lt;/em&gt;, known to us as sugarcane, would not only sweeten our foods but also stir the currents of history, culture, and human behavior. To understand the profound impact of sweetness, we must first trace its path through time and society.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sweetness is a perceptionâ€”a sensory experience that predates the widespread availability of refined sugar.
