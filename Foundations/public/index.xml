      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/docs/sweetness/overview/Cadbury.png&#34;&gt;s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the 2010s, Cadbury recieved complaints that their new chocolate was too sweet. Cadbury did not change their recipe. The company only changed the barâ€™s shape from angular to more rounded but there was an unmistakable boost of sweetness. Research into matter, showed that we have tendencey to  associate roundness with sweeter flavors. But this wasn&amp;rsquo;t the entire story.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A roundner shape means higher surface area for the same volume; mean this means that the new chocolate melted faster in the mouth and also had a stronger aroma.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
