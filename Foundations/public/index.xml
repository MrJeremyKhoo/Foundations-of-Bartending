      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the early 17th century, a small, unassuming plant began its journey from the lush fields of the Caribbean to the bustling markets of Europe. This plant, &lt;em&gt;Saccharum officinarum&lt;/em&gt;, known to us as sugarcane, would not only sweeten our foods but also stir the currents of history, culture, and human behavior. To understand the profound impact of sweetness, we must first trace its path through time and society.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sweetness is a perceptionâ€”a sensory experience that predates the widespread availability of refined sugar. In fact, humans have sought out sweet flavors for millennia, relying on natural sweeteners and ingredients to satisfy their cravings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When it comes to sweetness in drinks bartenders often think of adjusting it by changing the amount of syrup added to the drink. Sometimes that is not ideal, maybe the cocktail has already been prebatched or maybe changing the amount of syrup will throw off texture. Sweetness is a perception and there are many levers we can pull to adjust a drinks perception besides replying on the amount of &amp;ldquo;sweet&amp;rdquo; we pour into our drinks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
