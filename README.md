# **Foundations of Bartending**  

**Foundations of Bartending** is an open-source, essential guide to the craft of bartending. This project explores the art of mixology, bar management, hospitality, and the rich cultural history behind cocktails.  

The first book, **"Foundations of Bartending: Sweetness,"** delves into the role of sweetness in drinks—sugars, syrups, and liqueurs—and their impact on balance in cocktails.  

Built using **[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)**, this guide is a hands-on exploration of bartending’s science and art.
