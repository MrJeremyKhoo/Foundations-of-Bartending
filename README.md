# **Foundations of Bartending**  

I wanted a Foundational book on bartending. Independent of the product, trends and recipe. Sentiment and Market change; books on bartending quickly be come outdated. I hope this work will outlive its time.

Built using **[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)**, with Lotus Docs template this guide is a hands-on exploration of bartending’s science and art.
